# License

Hello! I intend to make Gorciu Studio available to everyone, but of course there must be conditions for using and contributing to the Gorciu Studio program. Below is the license you must follow when doing anything with Gorciu Studio.

## Definitions

`User` is a person who uses Gorciu Studio in any way or contributes to it.

`Gorciu` is the owner of Gorciu Studio and its original creator.

## Ownership

Gorciu DOES NOT grants the ownership of Gorciu Studio software to anyone who uses it, but grants them a license to use and contribute to the program in accordance with the license and instructions contained in the CONTRIBUTING.MD file contained in the source code.

## User rights

- The user has the right to create his own versions of Gorciu Studio, but must mention the author of the original version and must have project open-source.

- The user has the right to make changes to the Gorciu Studio code and request them to be added via the `Github Pull Requests` function.

## User obligations and prohibitions

- When creating a new JavaScript/TypeScript file, the user must add a note at the beginning of the file informing that it is part of Gorciu Studio. The user also cannot remove it from existing files.

- A user who wants to modify the Gorciu Studio code cannot add any spyware subprograms or any other code enabling user identification to the software.

## Disclaimers

- The software is provided without any warranty. Gorciu provides technical support for the two latest versions of Gorciu Studio (not counting corrections, i.e. if there is version `1.0.3`, only `1.0` counts without `.3`).

- Gorciu DOES NOT provide support for any of these:
  - not original modifications of Gorciu Studio
  - custom builds

- This license is valid from the time it is included in the source code. If the license changes, we will inform users about it via one of the official communication channels.
