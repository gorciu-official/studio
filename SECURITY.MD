# Security

I'm going to make my projects the most secure on the world. If you find the bug in this project read this section to get help with reporting it. It is short and contains only important informations.

## If it isn't the security vulnerability use Github Issues

This is the best place to report the bugs which aren't the security vulnerabilities. I'm checking them every day and fixing them (or create a TODO in my head to fix it).

## Reporting a security vulnerability

If you want to report this bug please contact me on Discord (gorciu_official), because this is only place when I can have these bugs private before fixing them.
